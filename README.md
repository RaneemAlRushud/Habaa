<h4> Hello I'm Raneem ðŸ’Ÿ, </h4>
<p> I will be introducing myself as a pet owner. As pet owners community, we're facing an issue and for this spirit I decided to build an initial solution  and I hope does its job; since the main goal behind this application is to solve a struggle. </p>

<p> While The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture does its best, some matters can still fall out of their reach. Pet owners usually struggle when they decide to abandon their pet permanently or temporarily (e.g., when they plan to travel for a few days).

<br>

As they cannot find places for pet adoptions easily, and same goes with the commercial stores. Sorrowfully, there are several reasons why pets are abandoned by their owners. These include re-location, loss of interest, and lack of money to care for them ... etc.
In this spirit, we encourage individuals who are seeking to serve their community as per adopting/abandoning a pet to register in Hebaâ€™a. as they will easily reach the pet owners in nearest locations through Hebaâ€™a application.

<br>
Hebaâ€™a establishes a direct link between the pet owners and the guardians. It will allow pet guardians to announce for pet adoption, and the guardians close-by locations to adopt that announced pet.

<br> 
<br> 
Hebaâ€™a is targeting two types of system actors who are:
<li> i. Pet owner is a person owning, harboring, or keeping a pet, or other
domestic pet, or having custody thereof. </li>
<li> ii. Guardian is a person who agrees to care for the pet on behalf of its owner
and taking the guardianship of and responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned permanently or for a period. </li> </p>


<h2> ðŸ’¡ Developing for Android</h2>
<li> :one: Android Studio </li>
<li> :two: Android SDK </li>
<li> :three: Android Virtual Devices (AVD) / Emulator </li>
<li>:four: Dalvik Debug Monitor Services (DDMS) </li>
<li> :five: The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) </li>
 
<h2> ðŸ’¡ Technology Stack:</h2>

<h2> ðŸ’¡ Future Consideration:</h2>
<li> :one: Because of the Android components limitation, the UI and app identity(color, icon .. etc) need to be enhanced in the next release. </li>
